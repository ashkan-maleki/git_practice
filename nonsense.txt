Godfather ipsum dolor sit amet. Sonny, please don't do anything. Please don't do anything. Leave the gun. Take the cannoli. Why did you go to the police? Why didn't you come to me first? Never hate your enemies. It affects your judgment. I know it was you, Fredo. You broke my heart. You broke my heart!

Don't you know that I would use all of my power to prevent something like that from happening? Vito, how do you like my little angel? Isn't she beautiful? I'm your older brother, Mike, and I was stepped over! It's an old habit. I spent my whole life trying not to be careless. Women and children can afford to be careless, but not men.

Is that why you slapped my brother around in public? I don't feel I have to wipe everybody out, Tom. Just my enemies. Only don't tell me you're innocent. Because it insults my intelligence and makes me very angry. What's the matter with you? Is this what you've become, a Hollywood finocchio who cries like a woman? "Oh, what do I do? What do I do?" What is that nonsense? Ridiculous!
